    What is DOM?
       -> The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
          It represents the page so that programs (like JavaScript) can
          change the document structure, style, and content.

        Key Points:

            > It turns every element, attribute, and text into a node
              that can be accessed and manipulated.

            > Think of it as a tree structure where each branch is an
              element on the webpage.


    _in any website_
        functions and other utilities
        > console.log(window.document)  ==  console.dir(document)

        html code
        > console.log(document)     // document is an object

        <!DOCTYPE html>             // mentions the document type is HTML
